# StreamProto

StreamProto: High-Level Prototyping Component Sets Using Streamlit

## Requirements

- Python version >= 3.9
- Streamlit

## Main Features

Streamlit is an excellent web application framework for Python developers with a primary focus on data domain knowledge. However, there is a gap between simple prototyping for visualization (e.g., in-house dashboards) and prototyping for public user testing. The purpose of this repository is to offer more features to prevent you from needing to delve into JavaScript, HTML, or CSS kind of things until they are absolutely necessary.

- Intuitive state manager for Streamlit sessions
- Clean and easily readable code design
- Simple code examples provided for each module
- Modular design for gradual customization of assets (work in progress)
- Installation script (work in progress)
