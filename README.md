# StreamProto

StreamProto: High-Level Prototyping Component Sets Using Streamlit

## Requirements

- Python version >= 3.9
- Streamlit

## Main Features

Streamlit is an excellent web application framework for Python developers, primarily focused on data domain knowledge. However, there exists a gap between simple prototyping for visualization, such as in-house dashboards, and prototyping for public user testing.

One of the main challenges you'll encounter when developing a basic web service using Streamlit is managing reusable code. The source code can quickly become convoluted and difficult to maintain, largely due to issues with state management.

The purpose of this repository is to offer more features to prevent you from needing to delve into JavaScript, HTML, or CSS kind of things or backend frameworks until they are absolutely necessary.

- Intuitive state manager for Streamlit sessions with examples
- Clean and easily readable code design
- Simple code examples provided for each module
- Modular design for gradual customization of assets (work in progress)
- Installation script (work in progress)
